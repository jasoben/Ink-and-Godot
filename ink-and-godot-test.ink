* [Tell me more!] -> tell_me_more
* [A talking ink pot, gadzooks!] -> a_talking_ink_pot

You see, a benevolent person on the internet made and maintains an add-on called inkgd that makes it MUCH easier than it would be otherwise (shout out to github.com/ephread aka Frédéric Maquin in Toronto Canada!) #tell-me-more

* [How delightful!] -> how_delightful
* [This is truly superb!] -> truly_superb
* [All hail the repo maintainers, let us observe the relevant XKCD comic!] -> xkcd

== a_talking_ink_pot ==

Yes what of it?! #a-talking-ink-pot

* [Well, ok, I suppose stranger things are possible. Tell me more...] -> tell_me_more

== how_delightful ==

Indeed! #delightful

* [All hail the repo maintainers, let us observe the relevant XKCD comic!] -> xkcd

== truly_superb ==

It certainly is! #superb

* [All hail the repo maintainers, let us observe the relevant XKCD comic!] -> xkcd
